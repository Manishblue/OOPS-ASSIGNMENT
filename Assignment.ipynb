    "# Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
    "# It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows methods to be implemented in various ways in different classes.\n",
    "# Abstraction:\n",

    "# Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features and ignoring unnecessary details.\n",
